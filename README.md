# Tic-tac-toe
This is my first project. Tic tac toe is a game of two players. There are nine  places for user input. Basically two players enter the input as a '0' or 'X' turn by turn. There are few conditions for win. If any condition is met then that player will be winner else if condition is not met and no place is empty then game will be draw.
